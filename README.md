### ðŸš€ My Journey

With a solid software development/programming career, I moved into technical management as the business expanded exponentially. While I tend to work with and enjoy backend development and product vision, I am most satisfied by offering value to the organisation where it is needed. This has led me to being flexible to work with business needs. Currenltly my focus is connecting with some hands on use of technology which is new to me in data engineering. 

### ðŸ’» Technical Skills

- **Languages:** C#, Python, SQL
- **Databases:** Microsoft SQL, PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Computing:** AWS (Lambdas, SQS, RDS, S3, MSK, MWAA), Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Databricks
- **Tools & Platforms:** Graphana, GitHub, Apache Airflow
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, RESTful API Development, Agile Methodologies


### ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Learning

I am committed to continuous learning and updating my skills. I am currently completing a Data Engineering course with AiCore and have a full stack/front-end course planned for later in the year. I am also interested in getting back into a personal robotics project and CGI for use in motion pictures. I am always open to collaborating on related projects or discussing new technologies and ideas.
