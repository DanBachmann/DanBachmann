<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align="center">Versatile Back End Developer &amp; Technical Co-ordinator
<br/>based in London, UK</h3>


### ðŸš€ My Journey

With a solid software development/programming career, I moved into technical management as the business expanded exponentially. While I tend to work with and enjoy backend development and product vision, I am most satisfied by offering value to the organisation where it is needed. This has led me to being flexible to work with business needs. Currenltly my focus is connecting with some hands on use of technology which is new to me in data engineering.

### ðŸ“ˆ Continuous Learning
I am in the process of completing a Data Engineering course with AiCore and have a full stack/front-end course planned for later in the year.
Other technical interests are getting back into a personal robotics project and CGI for use in motion pictures.
I am open to collaborating on related projects or discussing technologies and ideas!
